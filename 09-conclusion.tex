\section{Conclusion}

This document (D7.1 Evaluation Plan) contains the evaluation plan of the \SUMMA project. The evaluation process follows the V-Model and includes four stages, i.e., component testing, integration testing, functionality testing and user acceptance testing.

Final validation of the \SUMMA concept and use cases will be mainly accomplished through the validation of the prototype demonstrators in a real-world environment. The demonstrators will be implemented on top of the integrated \SUMMA platform, and can be customised for the different user partners.

The next iteration of the evaluation deliverable will be the initial evaluation report (D7.2), providing user feedback results of the use of the components, platform and use case in Month 18. A final evaluation report will follow at the end of the project in Month 36 (D7.3)

The planned evaluation process should ensure that there is a regular feedback cycle between user partners and technical partners and that users have ample opportunity to provide their views on the use of the tool and to suggest enhancements.
