\section{Use Cases}

This document describes the planning for the evaluation activities in the SUMMA project.
The purpose of the evaluation is to test the functionality, efficiency, usefulness and user-friendliness of the components, technologies, integrated platform and use cases of the SUMMA platform and to provide feedback as part of the iterative development process.

In line with the Description of Work, SUMMA will develop three use cases:
(1)	External monitoring – intelligent tools to address the dramatically increased scale of the global news monitoring task
(2)	Internal monitoring – managing content creation across several languages
(3)	Data journalism – using the SUMMA platform to enable deeper insights for journalists

The first two use cases have been described in deliverable D1.1 (Use Case Description and Requirements). The third one, on Data Journalism, will be developed in the course of the project. The internal and external use cases use the same underlying system and will primarily differ in terms of filtering and dashboarding options.
